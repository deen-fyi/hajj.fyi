            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              ·∏§ajj, one of the five pillars of Islamic practice, occurs once a year from the 8th-12th in the lunar calendar month of Dhul ·∏§ijjah. Nearly five million Muslims attend every year, making it the largest annual gathering of people in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              ·∏§ajj is a journey to Mecca commemorating the spirit of devotion to God (AllƒÅh) performed by Prophet Abraham [IbrƒÅhƒ´m] and his family. It entails visiting Mecca and performing rituals at other nearby regions in emulation of Prophet Abraham.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>The Backstory</h4>
            <p>
              Mecca is a sacred city in the Arabian Peninsula which was first inhabited by Abraham, Hagar [HƒÅjar], his wife, and Ishmael [IsmƒÅ øƒ´l], their son.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prophet Abraham was instructed by God to leave Hagar and son in this barren valley as a test to see whether he and his family were willing to endure their tribulations - lack of food and water, uninhabited, hot and no vegetation for shade - by placing their trust in God.
            </p>
            <p>
              By understanding that God is the ultimate source of all provisions, they were able to pass the test. As a reward, God made the region of Mecca a special place which would become the center for monotheism until the end of times.  
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Significance</h4>
            <p>
              Mecca has immense historical and religious value because Prophet Muhammad lived there for most of his life, and the first thirteen years of the revelation of the QurƒÅn occurred there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mecca‚Äôs religious merit lies primarily in the fact that it contains the Ka øbah (the iconic black cube structure), which all Muslims around the world face towards during ritual prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
              After Abraham‚Äôs return to Mecca, God instructed him and his son, Ishmael, to construct the structure of the Ka øbah, the first place dedicated entirely to the worship of one God alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ka‚Äôbah üïã represents the focal point of all Muslim worship and the unity of the Muslim community across the world. Muslims don‚Äôt pray to the Ka‚Äôbah, but rather prayer to the Lord of the Ka‚Äôbah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since Abraham‚Äôs time, people have been visiting the once-empty valley for thousands of years. Muslims are the latest in a long line of prophets and religious followers to direct their worship to the Ka‚Äôbah.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Virtues</h4>
            <p>
              ·∏§ajj has the potential of being one of the most rewarding acts of worship a Muslim can ever perform. Muslims endure the crowding and the heat in order to gain the pleasure and reward of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet Muhammad (may God bless and preserve his legacy) said, "Whoever performs ·∏§ajj sincerely for God and avoids obscenity and sins will return from the journey like the day his mother gave birth to him [i.e. with no sins]."
            </p>
            <p>
              The Prophet also taught Muslims that, ‚Äúthe only reward of an accepted ·∏§ajj is Paradise‚Äù
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>What to Expect</h4>
            <p>
              If someone you know is going to make the pilgrimage, then there may be a few changes to their looks when they return. During the rituals of ·∏§ajj, the migrants fulfill an act of grooming their heads. Prophet Muhammad encouraged the men to shave, while women are to trim. This can also be seen as a symbolic action of forgiveness, since Prophet Muhammad said the pilgrim will be sinless "like the day his mother gave birth to him"

                  Muslims only have to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lifetime, and they only have to do so if they have the financial means and physical health to get there and perform the tasks. However, there are many Muslims who choose to go multiple times, and some go every single year!

                  ·∏§ajj is an obligation at least once in a lifetime for Muslims who are able to go. Children, mentally handicapped, financially unable and physically unable people are exempted from performing ·∏§ajj. Many people save up their entire lives for this one event though there is no blame on them if they never accumulate enough savings to go.

                  Muslims look to Muhammad (may God bless and preserve his legacy) as their primary guide and teacher in this world. However, the Islamic tradition recognizes several other prophets. The QurƒÅn is filled with lessons from the lives of other prophets of God. These include, but aren‚Äôt limited to: Abraham, Noah, Jonas, Job, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus (May God preserve all their legacies). Muslims believe that Prophet Muhammad taught the pure and unadulterated rituals originially performed by Abraham, so Muslims are following both Abraham and Muhammad in this act.

                  ‚ÄúAllƒÅh,‚Äù is the Arabic for ‚ÄúThe God.‚Äù AllƒÅh is referring to Himself as ‚Äúthe one and only God,‚Äù but as a proper noun. Additionally, this is how AllƒÅh addresses Himself in the QurƒÅn, so Muslims like to use the name God gave for Himself over other translations and names.
